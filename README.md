## Running

For this project I'm using the free community version of Intellij by JetBrains. Had initially pulled up Eclipse and
NetBeans then remembered quickly just how awful they are. Been a paying user of PhpStorm for years but 
never really used Intellij so it made sense to give a go. Much better.

So with that preamble out of the way, load the project in Intellij and hit SHIFT-F10 to run everything.


## Versions
